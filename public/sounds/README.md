# Sound Files for Phone Interfaces

## Required Audio Files

This directory should contain the following sound files:

### 1. nextel-chirp.mp3
- Nextel walkie-talkie chirp sound
- Used when opening NexFone and push-to-talk
- Approximate duration: 0.5-1 second

### 2. berry-click.mp3
- BlackBerry keyboard click sound
- Used for BerryChat key presses
- Approximate duration: 0.1 second

## How to Add Sounds

You can:
1. Record your own sounds
2. Use royalty-free sound effects from sites like:
   - freesound.org
   - zapsplat.com
   - soundbible.com

## Fallback

If sound files are missing, the phone interfaces will work silently without errors.

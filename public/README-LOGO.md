# NURD Logo Setup Instructions

## Logo File

Please save the NURD drip logo image (the cyan/teal "NURD" text with purple drip effect) to:

```
public/nurd-drip-logo.png
```

The image you provided is already perfect! Just save it to that location.

## Alternative: Use from Attachments

If you have the image as an attachment in chat, save it to:
- Path: `c:\Users\rishj\OneDrive\Desktop\Nurds_Code_Dot_Com\public\nurd-drip-logo.png`

## Temporary Fallback

Until you add the logo, the upload zone will still work - the image will just show as broken. The functionality is fully implemented:

1. Drag & drop images
2. OCR extraction of code
3. Automatic redirect to Editor with extracted code
4. Kie.ai video generation ready

## Test the Upload Feature

1. Open `http://localhost:3000`
2. Take a screenshot of some code
3. Drag/drop onto the upload zone
4. Watch it extract the code and open in Editor! ✨

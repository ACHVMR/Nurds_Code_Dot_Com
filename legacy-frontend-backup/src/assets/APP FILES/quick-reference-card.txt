# 🚀 AchieveMore Quick Reference Card
**Print this. Keep at your desk. Reference daily.**

---

## DAILY CHECKLIST (5 min every morning)

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Morning routine
./scripts/morning-standup.sh | tee standup-$(date +%Y%m%d).log

# Check: uptime, errors, costs, deployments
# Share: Log with team in #engineering-standup
```

**What to look for:**
- ✅ Uptime > 99.9%?
- ✅ Error rate < 0.1%?
- ✅ Cost reasonable for requests?
- ❌ Any recent deployments? Any failed?

---

## EMERGENCY RESPONSE (When Something Breaks)

**Step 1: Determine Severity**
```
Is it affecting users? P1 (Critical)
Is it affecting internal systems? P2 (High)
Is it something we should fix soon? P3 (Medium)
```

**Step 2: Find Your Answer**
| Symptom | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| High latency (>5s) | Terminal Manual § 7.3 |
| 500 errors | Terminal Manual § 7 |
| Database connection lost | Terminal Manual § 2.1 |
| Temporal server down | Terminal Manual § 2.2 |
| Out of memory | Terminal Manual § 2.3 |
| Rate limit hit | Terminal Manual § 2.4 |
| Don't know what's wrong | Terminal Manual § 1.1 (status) |

**Step 3: Follow Steps Exactly**
- Don't improvise
- If unclear, escalate to senior engineer
- Document the fix

**Step 4: Create Incident Report**
```bash
cat > /incidents/incident-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).md << 'EOF'
## Incident: [Name]
**Time:** $(date)
**Severity:** P1/P2/P3
**Duration:** X minutes
**Cause:** [Root cause]
**Fix:** [What you did]
**Prevention:** [How to avoid next time]
EOF
```

## CODE DEPLOYMENT (Every deployment)

**Follow these steps EXACTLY:**

```bash
# 1. Feature branch
git checkout -b feature/my-feature

# 2. Make changes + test locally
pytest tests/ -v

# 3. Build & push
docker build -t achievemore/ii-agent:my-feature .
docker tag achievemore/ii-agent:my-feature \
    gcr.io/$GCP_PROJECT_ID/ii-agent:my-feature
docker push gcr.io/$GCP_PROJECT_ID/ii-agent:my-feature

# 4. Deploy to staging
gcloud run deploy ii-agent-staging \
    --image gcr.io/$GCP_PROJECT_ID/ii-agent:my-feature
sleep 10

# 5. Test staging
curl -X POST https://ii-agent-staging-xxx.run.app/test/resume-optimizer \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer ${STAGING_API_KEY}" \
    -d '{"resume_url":"test.pdf"}'

# 6. Deploy to production (via CLI - safest)
achievemore deploy production

# 7. Verify
achievemore status | grep ii-agent

# 8. Commit code
git add -A && git commit -m "feature: [description]"
git push origin feature/my-feature
# Create PR on GitHub
```

**If anything fails at any step:**
1. STOP (don't continue)
2. Rollback to previous version (if in production)
3. Debug in staging
4. Try again

---

## ORACLE ROUTING DECISIONS

**How to test Oracle:**
```bash
achievemore oracle "your request" app-id

# Example:
achievemore oracle "optimize my resume" resume-optimizer

# Output shows:
# - Model chosen
# - Temperature & max_tokens
# - Estimated cost
# - Success rate history
# - From cache? (yes/no)
```

**If routing seems wrong:**
- Check cache hit rate (Terminal Manual § 5)
- View routing rules: `cat /oracle/routing/app-id.json`
- Update if needed (Terminal Manual § 5)

---

## COST TRACKING (Weekly, Friday 5pm)

```bash
# Run weekly cost analysis
achievemore logs all 1000 | grep "cost" | \
    awk '{sum += $NF} END {print "Total cost: $" sum}'

# Check by model
sudo -u postgres psql -d achievemore_db << 'EOF'
SELECT model, ROUND(SUM(cost)::numeric, 2) as weekly_cost
FROM model_invocations
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY model
ORDER BY weekly_cost DESC;
EOF

# Monthly trend
# If cost rising:
# 1. Check which models are expensive
# 2. Update routing in Terminal Manual § 5
# 3. Increase cache TTL (cheaper)
# 4. Reduce token limits (faster + cheaper)
```

---

## PERFORMANCE ISSUES (If p99 latency > 5 seconds)

**Quick diagnostics:**

```bash
# 1. Check system resources
free -h          # Memory
df -h            # Disk
top              # CPU (q to quit)

# 2. Check database
sudo -u postgres psql -d achievemore_db << 'EOF'
SELECT query, calls, mean_exec_time FROM pg_stat_statements 
ORDER BY mean_exec_time DESC LIMIT 5;
EOF

# 3. Check model providers
# Visit: 
# - https://status.openai.com (OpenAI)
# - https://www.google.com/appsstatus (Google)
# - https://status.anthropic.com (Anthropic)

# 4. Profile a request
curl -v http://localhost:8000/api/resume/optimize \
    -H "X-Debug: true" | tee request.log

# 5. Fix based on findings
# Database slow? Add index (Platform DevOps § 10)
# Memory high? Reduce cache size
# Model slow? Switch provider
```

---

## MONITORING DASHBOARDS

**Check these every 2 hours when on-call:**

```bash
# System status
achievemore status

# Detailed metrics
achievemore metrics

# Recent errors (top 20)
achievemore logs all 100 | grep ERROR | head -20

# Current workflows (in progress)
curl http://localhost:8081/api/v1/workflows \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" | jq '.'
```

**Set alerts for:**
- CPU > 80% for 5+ minutes
- Memory > 85% for 5+ minutes
- Error rate > 1% for 10+ minutes
- Latency p99 > 10 seconds for 10+ minutes

## TROUBLESHOOTING FLOWCHART

```
Something broken?
    ↓
Can I restart the service?
    ├─ YES → Try: achievemore scale 0 && sleep 5 && achievemore scale 50
    ├─ Still broken? → Check Terminal Manual § 2
    └─ Database issue? → Check Terminal Manual § 2.1
    
Is data affected?
    ├─ YES (users lost resume) → Page senior eng immediately
    └─ NO → Less urgent, debug normally

Is it 3am and I'm on-call?
    ├─ YES → Fix only if critical (P1)
    ├─ Page-able? → Wake up senior eng
    └─ Not critical? → Document + hand off in morning standup
```

---

## IMPORTANT NUMBERS TO KNOW

```
Baseline Performance (normal conditions):
├─ Requests/second: 115 (1M users)
├─ Average latency: 2-3 seconds
├─ p99 latency: < 5 seconds
├─ Success rate: > 99%
└─ Cache hit rate: > 30%

Cost Metrics:
├─ LLM cost per request: $0.00015 (with optimization)
├─ Compute cost per request: $0.00004
├─ Total cost per request: $0.00019
├─ Monthly total cost: $44,745
└─ Cost per user/month: $0.045

Scaling Indicators:
├─ If p99 > 5s: Scale to 100 workers
├─ If p99 > 10s: Scale to 150 workers (and investigate)
├─ If error rate > 1%: Page senior eng
├─ If cost > $50K/month: Optimize routing + caching
```

## BEFORE YOU GO ON-CALL

**Checklist (must complete):**

- [ ] Read Terminal Manual § 2 (Emergency procedures) - MEMORIZE KEY ONES
- [ ] Read Terminal Manual § 7 (Troubleshooting)
- [ ] Run through 5 incident scenarios with senior eng
- [ ] Know phone numbers (above)
- [ ] Know escalation path (above)
- [ ] Have laptop charger + laptop fully charged
- [ ] Have quiet place to work (no distractions)
- [ ] Have water + snacks (might be long)
- [ ] Put Slack on phone
- [ ] Set up calendar blocking (so no meetings)

---

## THE GOLDEN RULES

1. **Always follow Terminal Manual § 1.2 when deploying**
   - Don't skip steps
   - Don't merge to main without this

2. **Always escalate if unsure**
   - Better to wake up senior eng than cause outage
   - It's literally their job to help

3. **Always document everything**
   - Incident report (even if resolved quick)
   - Update to Terminal Manual (if new procedure)
   - Slack post (so team knows what happened)

4. **Always test in staging first**
   - Never deploy directly to production
   - Always verify staging works

5. **Always check Terminal Manual § 2 first**
   - Before doing anything else
   - 95% of incidents are in there

6. **Always optimize for user impact**
   - Smallest fix to get users back
   - Debug deeper afterward
   - Temporary fix is better than no fix

7. **Always be ready to rollback**
   - Keep previous version in mind
   - Know how to deploy previous
   - Do it fast if needed

---

## LAST 10 COMMITS

Check what was recently deployed:

```bash
git log --oneline -10
# Shows recent changes
# If something broke, rollback to commit before the break:
git revert HEAD~1  # Revert most recent commit
```

---

## QUICK COMMANDS (Copy & Paste)

**Morning standup:**
```bash
./scripts/morning-standup.sh
```

**Check status:**
```bash
achievemore status
```

**View logs:**
```bash
achievemore logs all 100 | grep ERROR | tail -20
```

**Scale workers:**
```bash
achievemore scale 100
```

**Test Oracle routing:**
```bash
achievemore oracle "optimize my resume" resume-optimizer
```

**Deploy to staging:**
```bash
docker build -t test:latest . && docker run test:latest npm test
```

**Deploy to production:**
```bash

```

**Check cost:**
```bash
sudo -u postgres psql -d achievemore_db -c \
    "SELECT SUM(cost) FROM model_invocations WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 day';"
```

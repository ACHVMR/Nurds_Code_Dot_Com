# BINGE CODE ENGINEERING
## Autonomous Effort-Driven Delivery Framework

---

## FRAMEWORK OVERVIEW

Binge Code Engineering is an operational framework for autonomous, self-evolving software delivery. It measures effort in tokens (not time), quotes transparently, and improves with every execution.

**Core Principle:** No time contracts. Only effort contracts. Instant start. Measured duration.

---

## EXECUTION FLOW

```
USER SUBMITS REQUEST
        ↓
HUDDLE (Discern & Quote)
  • Parse intent via NLP
  • Clarify ambiguities
  • Estimate tokens + cost
  • User approves scope
        ↓
BINGE EXECUTION (Instant → TBD)
  FOSTER (Research & Planning)
    • 10–30% of effort
    • Design + planning
  DEVELOP (Implementation)
    • 50–70% of effort
    • Build + integrate
  HONE (Optimize & Test)
    • 10–20% of effort
    • Validate + finalize
        ↓
VALIDATE & EVOLVE
  • Verify acceptance criteria
  • Log execution metrics
  • Check for updates
  • Auto-evolve if beneficial
        ↓
DEPLOY (Instant)
  • Ship to production
  • Deliver complete artifacts
  • Notify of any autonomous changes
```

## CORE COMPONENTS

### ACHEEVY (Orchestrator)
- Parses user requests via NLP
- Asks clarifying questions (does not accept input as literal)
- Designs execution plans
- Estimates effort in tokens
- Routes work via ACP protocol
- Supervises execution; prevents inefficiency
- Maintains decision context across all phases

### Boomer_Angs (Specialist Agents)
- CodeAng – Implementation & architecture
- DataAng – Database & data operations
- ScoutAng – Research & analysis
- MultiAng – Multi-service orchestration
- ResearchAng – Planning & synthesis
- SecurityAng – Audits & compliance
- TerminalAng – DevOps & deployment
- InterceptorAng – Logging & monitoring
- PresentAng – Documentation & reports
- LearnAng – Model training coordination
- RLAng – Reinforcement learning
- Plus 6 additional specialists

Each agent specializes in one domain. All communicate via ACP protocol.

### ACP Protocol (Agentic Communication)
- HTTP-based, JSON-structured communication
- Simple request/response format
- Autonomous routing by ACHEEVY
- Transparent to end users
- Replaces complexity of other protocols

---

## FDH PIPELINE

Every job executes three phases sequentially (instant start, TBD duration):

**FOSTER (10–30% of effort)**
- Understand requirements
- Research & analysis
- Design architecture
- Plan implementation
- Define success criteria

**DEVELOP (50–70% of effort)**
- Execute implementation
- Build features end-to-end
- Integrate services
- Apply quality gates
- Track progress real-time

**HONE (10–20% of effort)**
- Test all scenarios
- Optimize performance
- Security audit
- Documentation
- Final validation

---

## EFFORT TOKENS & COST

**Estimation Formula:**
```
Estimated Tokens = Base[Job Type] × Complexity Multiplier × Integration Factor
Cost = (Estimated Tokens ÷ 1,000,000) × LLM Pricing
```

**Example:**
```
Job: Complex CRM Implementation

Base Tokens: 100,000
Complexity: 2.0x (integrations, custom UI)
Integrations: 1.5x (Salesforce, Slack, etc.)

Estimated = 100,000 × 2.0 × 1.5 = 300,000 tokens
Cost = (300,000 ÷ 1,000,000) × $15 = $4.50 per deployment

Quote Range: $4.50–$13.50 (1–3 expected deployments)
```

**Accuracy Progression:**
- First 10 jobs (same type): ±30% accuracy
- After 50 jobs: ±15% accuracy
- After 100+ jobs: ±5% accuracy

---

## LLL LOOP (Continuous Learning)

Embedded in every execution:

**LOOK** – Monitor real-time metrics
- Token consumption vs. estimate
- Phase duration
- Agent performance
- Service latency

**LISTEN** – Gather intelligence
- Error logs
- HITL feedback
- Performance metrics
- End-user feedback

**LEARN** – Adapt & improve
- Update effort models
- Refine tool selection
- Trigger self-evolution
- Improve next estimate

---

## SELF-EVOLUTION

Autonomous platform improvement across all integrated tools:

**Monitoring:**
- New LLM versions
- New tool releases
- API deprecations & breaking changes
- Performance improvements

**Decision Logic:**
- 10%+ improvement detected → Auto-activate (or alert)
- Mixed results → Alert for human decision
- Regression detected → Hold & monitor

**Transparency:**
- Every update logged with timestamp & metrics
- Rollback always available
- Customer notified of autonomous changes

---

## INSTANT → TBD

The time model for all execution:

- **INSTANT** = Work starts immediately (no delay)
- **TBD** = Duration unknown until work completes
- **Never fixed** = No preset hours; only measured effort

---

## HITL (Humans In The Loop)

HITL is invoked in only two scenarios:

1. **Huddle Phase** – If ambiguity detected, ask clarifying questions (5–60 min pause)
2. **Binge Execution** – If major decision needed mid-execution (5–30 min pause)

HITL is NOT used for:
- Status checks
- Approval gates every 30 minutes
- Scheduled meetings
- Routine decision-making

---

## MULTI-ACCOUNT ISOLATION

Each customer/account receives:

- **Isolated ACHEEVY Core** – Own orchestrator instance
- **Own Boomer_Angs Pool** – Dedicated agents (or shared, configurable)
- **Encrypted Data Lake** – Private execution logs & metrics
- **Independent Evolution** – Autonomous updates per account
- **Configuration Template** – Customizable LLM choices, tools, rules

**Zero cross-contamination between accounts.**

---

## TOOL AGNOSTICISM

The framework works with any LLM provider, API, or external service:

- OpenAI (GPT-4, GPT-4.5, etc.)
- Google (Gemini 3, 3.2, etc.)
- Manus AI
- Open-source models
- Custom proprietary tools
- Any service communicating via ACP

---

## PLUG & PLAY CONFIGURATION

To inject into any platform, define:

1. **LLM Stack** – Which models to use (Pro vs. Flash, primary vs. fallback)
2. **Boomer_Angs** – Which agents needed for your domain
3. **Custom Agents** – Create platform-specific agents (e.g., `VideoTranscoderAng`)
4. **Integration Catalog** – Which external APIs/services to call
5. **Evolution Rules** – Auto-update or require manual approval
6. **Billing Model** – Per-job, subscription, or custom

All configuration is isolated per customer/account.

---
